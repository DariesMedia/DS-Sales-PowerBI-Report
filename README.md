## Daries-Supermarket-Sales-Analysis

Cleaning and analysing Daries Supermarket Sales data as well as creating a report in PowerBI

## Introduction

This project was one that resulted from a search for a project that would involve working with data and which the insights would be interesting to see. 

The documentation includes:
- Report Requirements
- Insight/Solutions
- Conclusion

## Report Requirement
While planning for this project the initial purpose of creating the report was to see the overall number of transactions, total sales quantity, overall cost of goods, gross income, overall sales by customer type, which month had the highest gross income and best performing branch of the supermarket. 

However, during the report design I was also interested in creating a report that tracks which payment channel made the most sales and what time of day the sales came in.

In summary, the report requirement was to provide an overall trend of sales activity to enable the business make better decisions.

## Insight/Solution
After cleaning and analysing the data, attached below is the report.

From the report, it was revealed that products in fashion accessories made the most sales. January had the highest gross income. The supermarket branch in Yangon made the most sales. Overall sales was made with E-wallet, followed by Cash payment. Customers made more purchases between the hours of 7pm - 7:59pm & 1pm - 1:59pm.
